Building and Installation from Source Code
-------------------------------------------

You need the Linux C/C++ Compiler (with make), cmake, the Qt libraries and git. 
To install these on Lubuntu use the terminal commands below. 
With Debian install these packages as superuser.

sudo apt install build-essential 
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install qt5-default
sudo apt install qtbase5-dev
sudo apt install qt5base5-dev-tools
sudo apt install git 

Note: You can use "cmake --version" to check the installed version of cmake

The repository of lxqt-organizer can be downloaded using

git clone https://github.com/lxqt/lxqt-organizer.git

Note: You can update the respository at a later stage using "git pull"

Change to the respository directory,create a “Built Directory” and change to the build directory.

mkdir build
cd build

Now run cmake as follows

cmake ..

Make sure not to omit the periods after cmake command.

The cmake command should create a Makefile in the build directory. Now run

make   (or use make VERBOSE=1)

Root authorisation is required to install the software using

sudo make install

The default installation directory is “/usr/local”.

You can change the installation directory by modifying the configuration of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX of CMake.

Copy the lxqt-organizer.desktop file to /usr/share/applications to add a menu item.

sudo cp lxqt-organizer.desktop /usr/share/applications
