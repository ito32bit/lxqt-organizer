# Organizer

## Overview

Organizer is a Qt lightweight personal information manager.

It is maintained by the LXQt project but can be used independently from this
desktop environment.


### Compiling source code

Please don't do this on production systems

```
mkdir build  
cd build  
cmake ..
make
su (or sudo)
make install
```

Organizer is installed to /usr/local/bin

Note: If upgrading from a previous version you need to remove the previous version (as root) located at

/usr/local/bin/organizer
